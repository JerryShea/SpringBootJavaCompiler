This demonstrates how to use Java compiler with spring far jars.

To test:

```
mvn install
java -jar target/spring-boot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If you don't see any exceptions then this has worked.

See `com.example.springboot.ExtractSpringBootClasses` and `com.example.springboot.HelloController#HelloController`
